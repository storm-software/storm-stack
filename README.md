At a high-level, **‚ö° Storm Stack** is a toolchain system that generates code and other artifacts during the build and deploy processes via TypeScript transformers and static code analysis. Many modern code generation tools require you to explicitly define the structure and behavior of your code in separate schema files and/or configurations, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Some tools even require you to learn a new SDL or write boilerplate code to wire everything together. **Storm Stack does not require any extra work - you just write your code the way you normally would, and Storm Stack does the rest**.

**The goal is to allow the developer to focus on the actual application/business logic, rather than the specifics around technologies, frameworks, or cloud providers.** This is achieved by using a set of powerful tools and extensible plugins that are designed to work together.

Storm Stack is largely built on top of [Deepkit](https://deepkit.io/), so our projects benefit from access to very small bytecode type definitions at runtime. **This means you have builtin serialization, deserialization, or validation logic without writing any additional code (with greatly improved performance and reduced bundle sizes when compared to popular packages like Zod, Yup, class-validator, and Valibot)**.

The Storm Stack monorepo contains the [Storm Stack engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/core) package and various plugins and tools to help developers using the toolchain. More details can be found below in the [Features](#features) section.

> [!NOTE] 
> Some features of Storm Stack are opinionated to meet the needs of [Storm Software](https://stormsoftware.com); however, it should be simple to customize the behavior to fit any specific requirements you may have. If you believe any plugins include logic that should be split out into separate packages, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue, and we will be happy to discuss it.

# Features

The core functionality of Storm Stack is built around the concept of a "stack" of tools and services that work together seamlessly. This includes everything from code generation and transformation to deployment and monitoring.

The following sections outline some of the features/publishable content included in this repository.

## Engine

The _Storm Stack Engine_ is an actual class that drives the Storm Stack pipeline's commands; however, the phrase is also often used to describe the base packages containing the core architecture (primarily the [@storm-stack/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/core) and [@storm-stack/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/cli) packages).

### [@storm-stack/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/core)

The [@storm-stack/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/core) package
includes the Storm Stack engine - used to drive the Storm Stack pipeline's commands.

The following features are included in the package:

- The `Engine` class - responsible for orchestrating the various stages of the Storm Stack pipeline. This can be used as a sort of API for driving the processes from an external tool or service.
- Extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of new tools and services.
- Utilities and helpers for working with the Storm Stack ecosystem.
- Various build plugins (supported by [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin)) that allow you to benefit from Storm Stack's features, such as code generation, transformation, and deployment, while using an external build system.

Some of the supported build systems with existing plugins are:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

### [@storm-stack/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/cli)

This package provides a binary to interact with the Storm Stack engine via a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

The following features are included in the package:

- Inclusion of required commands and options for Storm Stack development.
- Utilities for managing local project dependencies and scripts.
- Integration with the Storm Stack ecosystem for seamless project management.

## Plugins

The following Storm Stack plugin packages are included in this repository:

### [@storm-stack/plugin-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/plugin-config)

A plugin to generate TypeScript definitions, apply static parameter values, and encourage best practices for managing configuration in Storm Stack applications.

The plugin provides a set of utilities for working with configuration files, including:

- TypeScript definition generation for configuration schemas.
- `$storm.config.<parameter>` object is used to apply static configuration parameter values at build time with automatic type generation for improved type safety.
- Logic to determine all used configuration parameters so that they can be validated and documented later.
- Best practice recommendations for organizing and managing configuration.
- The `storm:config` builtin runtime module, which contains the `StormConfig` type definition and related utilities for working with configuration parameters at runtime.

### [@storm-stack/plugin-date](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/plugin-date)

A plugin package that injects a consistent interface into the application for working with dates across some popular JavaScript libraries, such as `date-fns`, `dayjs`, `luxon`, and `moment.js`. **Never feel the pressure to choose a date library again!**

This plugin was inspired by (and largely lifted from) [date-io](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/date-io), which provides a similar interface for date manipulation. The key difference is that this plugin will inject the date manipulation logic into the application at build time, rather than at runtime, allowing for more consistent and performant code.

Huge thanks to [dmtrKovalenko](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko) for their work on date-io.

### [@storm-stack/plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storm-stack/plugin-node)
