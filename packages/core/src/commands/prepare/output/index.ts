/**
 * Prepares deployment configuration/infrastructure required by the Storm Stack project in CI/CD processes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Some examples of potential artifacts that could be prepared by this step include (but are not limited to):
 * - Cloudflare Workers configuration files
 * - Kubernetes deployment manifests
 * - Docker Compose files for containerized applications
 * - Terraform scripts for infrastructure as code (IaC)
 * - Helm charts for Kubernetes applications
 * - Ansible playbooks for server configuration management
 * - CloudFormation templates for AWS infrastructure
 * - Pulumi scripts for cloud infrastructure provisioning
 * - Vagrant files for local development environments
 * - CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
 *
 * @param context - The context containing options and environment paths.
 * @param hooks - The engine hooks to call during preparation.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the preparation is complete.
