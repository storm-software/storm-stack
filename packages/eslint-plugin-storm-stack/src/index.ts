 * This package contains the ESLint plugin for Storm Stack, which provides
 * a set of rules and configurations for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code.
 * It includes a set of recommended rules, as well as a strict configuration
 * that enforces a more opinionated style. The plugin is designed to be used
 * with ESLint, a popular linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript.
 *
 * This package also includes additional utilities for enhancing the linting
 * experience and ensuring code quality across projects.
